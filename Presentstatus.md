# TalentSpark Recruit - Current Implementation Status

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current implementation status of the TalentSpark Recruit application, including what has been implemented, what's pending, and any issues in the current implementation.

## Overview

TalentSpark Recruit is a SmartMatch-powered recruitment platform designed specifically for US-based recruiting consultancies. The application provides role-based dashboards for different user types (CEO, Branch Manager, Marketing Head, Marketing Supervisor, Marketing Recruiter, Marketing Associate, and Applicant) and includes features for managing teams, profiles, resumes, candidates, budgets, and profit optimization.

The platform's core value proposition is its sophisticated two-level profit tracking system that allows consulting firms to maximize their margins through:
1. Client-to-company profit tracking (difference between client budget and internal budget)
2. Company-to-candidate profit tracking (company's share of the internal budget)

The application follows a hierarchical organization structure where admins can add locations and hiring managers, while hiring managers can add departments and employees for their specific location branch.

### Current Limitations

While the UI components and profit optimization features are well-implemented, the application still requires backend integration to become a fully functional product. The current implementation serves as a comprehensive prototype that fulfills the core business requirements specified in the project documentation, but needs real data integration for production use.

### Priority Improvements

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Implementing a backend API with real data storage for profit configuration
   - Setting up PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension for RAG implementation
   - Creating data models for the hierarchical organization structure

2. **Authentication & Security**

The application has been successfully deployed to Vercel from GitHub, with the repository already initiated for continuous deployment. With the profit optimization features and US-specific recruiting consultancy requirements now in place, the platform delivers on its core value proposition and provides a solid foundation for future development.
