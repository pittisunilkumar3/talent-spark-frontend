2. **2-API Integration** - API client and service implementation
   - API client setup with Axios
   - Authentication service implementation

3. **3-Feature Implementation** - Specific feature implementations
   - Job management
   - Job listings page

4. **4-Deployment** - Deployment and production guides
   - Backend deployment (Heroku/Railway)
   - Frontend deployment (Vercel)

5. **5-Roadmap** - High-level planning documents
   - Task checklist
   - Integration roadmap

6. **6-Backend Documentation** - Detailed backend reference
   - API endpoint documentation
   - Implementation status checklist
   - RAG workflow for resume parsing
   - Frontend-backend integration reference

7. **7-Backend Analysis** - Analysis of existing backend code
   - Backend structure assessment
   - Integration recommendations
   - Customization needs

8. **8-Production Guide** - Working with the codebase in production
   - Backend usage and development workflow
   - API structure and extension
   - Best practices and deployment

## Recommended Reading Order

For the most effective implementation, we recommend following this reading order:

1. Start with **5-Roadmap/integration-roadmap.md** for a high-level overview
2. Review **5-Roadmap/tasks.md** for a detailed task checklist
3. Read **7-Backend Analysis/backend-analysis.md** for backend assessment
4. Review **8-Production Guide/backend-usage-guide.md** for backend workflow
5. Review **6-Backend Documentation/API-Documentation.md** for API reference
6. Follow **1-Project Setup/backend-setup-guide.md** to set up your backend
7. Implement the API client using **2-API Integration/implementation-guide.md**
8. Connect authentication using **2-API Integration/auth-integration-guide.md**
9. Implement job features using **3-Feature Implementation/job-integration-guide.md**
10. Create the job listings page using **3-Feature Implementation/job-listings-page-guide.md**
11. Deploy your application using **4-Deployment/deployment-guide.md**
12. Implement advanced features using **6-Backend Documentation/RAG-Workflow-Documentation.md**

## Development Approach

We recommend a phased approach to development:

1. **Backend-First Development** - Set up the backend before implementing frontend features
2. **Feature-by-Feature Implementation** - Implement one feature at a time from backend to frontend
3. **Role-Based Testing** - Test each feature with different user roles to ensure proper access control

## Getting Started

To begin development:

1. Set up your development environment with Node.js, npm, and PostgreSQL
2. Follow the backend setup guide to configure your database and server
3. Implement the API client and authentication service
4. Continue with feature implementation in a logical order
5. Deploy your application when ready

Happy coding!
