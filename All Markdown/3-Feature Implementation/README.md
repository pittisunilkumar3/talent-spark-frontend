# Feature Implementation

This folder contains documentation for implementing specific features of the QORE Recruitment Platform.

## Contents

- **job-integration-guide.md** - Guide for implementing the job service and components
- **job-listings-page-guide.md** - Guide for implementing the job listings page

## Job Integration Guide

The job integration guide covers:

1. **Job Service** - Implementing the job service with:
   - Type definitions
   - API methods for CRUD operations
   - Filtering and pagination

2. **Job Components** - Creating reusable components:
   - JobCard for displaying job information
   - JobFilters for filtering job listings

## Job Listings Page Guide

The job listings page guide covers:

1. **Supporting Services** - Implementing department and location services
2. **UI Components** - Creating pagination and other UI components
3. **Page Implementation** - Building the job listings page with:
   - Data fetching with React Query
   - Filtering and pagination
   - Error handling and loading states
   - Role-based permissions

## Implementation Order

We recommend implementing these features in the following order:

1. Job service with basic CRUD operations
2. Supporting services (departments, locations)
3. UI components (JobCard, JobFilters, Pagination)
4. Job listings page with data fetching
5. Additional job-related features (creation, editing, deletion)

## Key Concepts

- **Data Fetching** - Using React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Component Composition** - Building complex UIs from reusable components
- **Filtering and Pagination** - Implementing client and server-side filtering
- **Role-Based UI** - Showing different UI elements based on user roles

## Next Steps

After implementing the job features:

1. Implement other core features (applications, interviews, offers)
2. Add advanced features (resume parsing, matching, budget tracking)
3. Test all features with different user roles
4. Proceed to deployment when ready
