# API Integration

This folder contains documentation for implementing the API client and service modules for the QORE Recruitment Platform.

## Contents

- **implementation-guide.md** - Step-by-step instructions for implementing the API client and service modules
- **auth-integration-guide.md** - Guide for implementing authentication with the real API

## Implementation Guide

The implementation guide covers:

1. **API Client Setup** - Creating a centralized Axios client with:
   - Token management
   - Request/response interceptors
   - Error handling

2. **Service Modules** - Implementing service modules for:
   - Authentication
   - Users
   - Jobs
   - Applications
   - Other resources

## Authentication Integration Guide

The authentication integration guide covers:

1. **AuthContext Update** - Replacing mock authentication with real API calls
2. **Protected Routes** - Implementing role-based access control
3. **Login Form Connection** - Connecting the login form to the API

## Implementation Order

We recommend implementing these components in the following order:

1. API client with basic configuration
2. Authentication service
3. AuthContext with real API integration
4. Protected routes
5. Login and registration forms
6. Other service modules as needed

## Key Concepts

- **Token Management** - Storing and refreshing JWT tokens
- **Error Handling** - Standardized error handling across the application
- **Type Safety** - Using TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- **Service Pattern** - Organizing API calls into service modules

## Next Steps

After implementing the API integration:

1. Proceed to the Feature Implementation folder to implement specific features
2. Test authentication flows with different user roles
3. Implement additional service modules as needed
