# QORE Recruitment Platform - Integration Roadmap

This document provides a comprehensive roadmap for integrating the frontend and backend of the QORE Recruitment Platform, creating a production-grade application.

## Overview

The QORE Recruitment Platform is a comprehensive recruitment and applicant tracking system designed for US-based recruiting consultancies. The platform features role-based access control, profit optimization, SmartMatch-powered candidate matching, and a hierarchical organization structure.

## Documentation Structure

1. **tasks.md**: A detailed checklist of tasks organized by phase
2. **implementation-guide.md**: Step-by-step instructions for implementing the API client and service modules
3. **auth-integration-guide.md**: Guide for implementing authentication with the real API
4. **job-integration-guide.md**: Guide for implementing the job service
5. **job-listings-page-guide.md**: Guide for implementing the job listings page
6. **backend-setup-guide.md**: Guide for setting up and configuring the backend

   - Set up automated testing and deployment

## Implementation Approach

### Backend-First Development

We recommend a backend-first approach:

1. Set up and configure the backend first
2. Test API endpoints with tools like Postman
3. Implement frontend services and components
4. Connect frontend components to API endpoints

This approach ensures that the API contract is established early and reduces the need for frontend changes later.

### Feature-by-Feature Implementation

Implement features one at a time, following this pattern:

1. Create backend endpoints for the feature
2. Implement frontend service for the feature
3. Create UI components for the feature
4. Connect components to the service
5. Test the feature end-to-end

This approach allows you to deliver working features incrementally rather than implementing everything at once.

### Role-Based Testing

Test each feature with different user roles:

1. Test as CEO/Admin to verify full access
2. Test as Branch Manager to verify location-specific access
3. Test as Marketing Recruiter to verify limited access
4. Test as Applicant to verify public access

This ensures that role-based access control works correctly across the application.

## Key Integration Points

### Authentication Flow

The authentication flow connects the frontend and backend:

1. User enters credentials in the login form
2. Frontend sends credentials to `/api/auth/login` endpoint
3. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT tokens
4. Frontend stores tokens and user data
5. Frontend includes token in subsequent API requests
6. Backend validates token and grants access

### Data Fetching Pattern

Use a consistent pattern for data fetching:

1. Create a service function that calls the API endpoint
2. Use React Query to manage data fetching, caching, and state
3. Handle loading, error, and success states in the component
4. Display appropriate UI for each state

### Form Submission Pattern

Use a consistent pattern for form submissions:

1. Create a form component with validation
2. Connect form to React Hook Form and Zod for validation
3. On submit, call the appropriate service function
4. Handle loading, error, and success states
5. Show appropriate feedback to the user

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### CORS Issues

If you encounter CORS issues:

1. Ensure the backend CORS configuration includes your frontend origin
2. Check that the request includes the correct headers
3. Verify that the backend is responding with the correct CORS headers

### Authentication Problems

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Check that tokens are being stored correctly
2. Verify that tokens are included in API requests
3. Ensure token refresh is working properly
4. Check for token expiration

### Data Type Mismatches

If you encounter data type issues:

1. Ensure TypeScript interfaces match the API response structure
2. Use type guards to handle potential null or undefined values
3. Implement proper error handling for unexpected data

## Next Steps After Integration

Once the basic integration is complete:

1. **Enhance user experience**
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Improve responsive design
   - Optimize performance

2. **Implement advanced features**
   - Real-time notifications
   - Advanced reporting and analytics
   - Document generation

3. **Scale the application**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

## Conclusion

Following this roadmap will help you successfully integrate the frontend and backend of the QORE Recruitment Platform. The phased approach allows for incremental progress and early detection of issues, while the feature-by-feature implementation ensures that you can deliver working functionality throughout the development process.

Remember to refer to the specific guide documents for detailed instructions on implementing each part of the integration.
